# Digits

This test focuses on working with the individual digits inside numbers.

The number `273` has 3 digits: `2`, `7`, and `3`.

## ⚠️ Note

There is **far** too much work here to be done in the time you've been given. You are **not** expected to complete the whole challenge. 

## Tasks

Work through the following tasks **in order**. 

Each task should be completed **before** moving on to the next:

1. Given a number, identify the largest integer that can be formed by rearranging its digits.
  - `100` -> `100`
  - `4231` -> `4321`
  - `1923` -> `9321`
2. Given a number, identify the largest continuous 3-digit sequence within it (without rearrangement).
  - `4449994` -> `999`
  - `1270099` -> `700`
  - `120800000033` -> `800`
3. Given a number, identify the smallest number that can be formed by rearranging any continuous 3-digit sequence.
  - `100` -> `1`
  - `13872134` -> `378`
4. Given a number, identify the difference between the largest number that can be formed by rearranging any continuous 3-digit sequence and the smallest number that can be formed from by rearranging any continuous 3-digit sequence within it.
  - `123` -> `198` (smallest: 123, largest: 321)
  - `400099` -> `990` (smallest: 000, largest: 990)   
5. Given a list of numbers, find the total difference between the largest and smallest 3-digit sequences within each one (without rearrangement).
6. Given a list of numbers, find the average of the smallest numbers that can be formed from any continuous 4-digit sequence in each number.
